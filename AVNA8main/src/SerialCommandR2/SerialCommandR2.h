/* ****************************************************************************** 
SerialCommandR is a modification of SerialCommand
1 - Sets default end of command, term, to '#'
2 - Makes term programable with method .setTerm(char t).
3 - Always allows comma and space as token separators
4 - Removes leading spaces and term characters on commands
5 - Added provision for response, set by .setResonnse(uint16_t resp)
6 - Changed diagnostic character echo to Hex to see everything.
7 - Increased buffer size to 50 for long commands

* Added processCh(uint8_t c) to allow external character inputs
*       RSL 25 Jan 2020

SerialCommand - An Arduino library to tokenize and parse commands received over
a serial port.

Version 20131021A.   

Version History:
May 11 2011 - Initial version
May 13 2011 -   Prevent overwriting bounds of SerialCommandCallback[] array in addCommand()
            defaultHandler() for non-matching commands
Mar 2012 - Some const char * changes to make compiler happier about deprecated warnings.  
           Arduino 1.0 compatibility (Arduino.h header) 
Oct 2013 - SerialCommand object can be created using a SoftwareSerial object, for SoftwareSerial
           support.  Requires #include <SoftwareSerial.h> in your sketch even if you don't use 
           a SoftwareSerial port in the project.  sigh.   See Example Sketch for usage. 
Oct 2013 - Conditional compilation for the SoftwareSerial support, in case you really, really
           hate it and want it removed.
